Your scenario is Ujjain Mahakumbh → huge crowds, temporary + permanent structures, ghats, city roads. Input is drone + CCTV video, requiring real-time detection (low latency, high fps). Context like Google Street View / GIS can be used later to check legality.

Here’s a revised, focused suggestion for your project:

🔑 Key Requirements

Real-time video inference → high FPS, low latency.

Crowded scenes → many small objects, temporary stalls, pandals, tents.

Mixed input (drone top-down + CCTV side view) → need robustness to angle changes.

Legality classification requires vision + metadata overlay (cannot be solved by vision alone).

🚀 Recommended Model Stack
1. Primary Detector (Real-Time Backbone)

Use YOLOv12-S or YOLOv12-M (2025 latest YOLO variant).

Optimized for speed + accuracy.

Pretrained weights available on COCO, fine-tune on your festival/ghat dataset.

Deployment-friendly (ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO for edge inference).

Handles object detection: stalls, pandals, permanent shops, barricades, crowds, vehicles, boats, etc.

👉 Why not YOLOv12-L/X? They’re too heavy for real-time drone/CCTV pipelines.

2. Segmentation Layer (Optional, for fine control)

Add a fast segmentation model to refine boundaries:

YOLOv12-seg variant (if available) → same backbone, segmentation heads.

Or Lightweight DeepLabV3+ with MobileNet/Swin backbone → balances accuracy & speed.

Useful for delineating: pandal boundaries, road blocking, riverbed encroachment.

3. Context/Legality Decision Layer

Detection alone won’t decide legal vs illegal. You need post-processing logic:

Overlay detection results with GIS layers:

River buffer zones (e.g. 50m–100m from ghats).

Road carriageway & footpath layouts.

Authorized vendor zones / festival-permitted areas (from admin data).

If detection falls inside restricted zone → mark as Illegal.

If detection falls inside permitted zone / barricaded area → mark as Legal.

👉 This layer is lightweight, can run in parallel with detection. You can use geofencing logic.

4. Supporting Models (Optional Enhancers)

Segment Anything Model (SAM2 or FastSAM) → interactive segmentation for labeling dataset quickly.

GroundingDINO → zero-shot object detection; can help expand dataset (e.g., “detect tents/pandals”).

Crowd Counting (CSRNet or YOLOv8-count) → for estimating density at ghats/roads during Kumbh.

⚡ Deployment Recommendations

Pipeline:
Drone/CCTV feed → YOLOv12 (TensorRT) → Legality overlay layer → Alert dashboard.

Inference Hardware:

NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX / AGX for edge (on-site, drones, control rooms).

Or GPU servers (A100/H100/RTX 4090) if centralised processing is possible.

Throughput:

YOLOv12-S/M → ~60–120 FPS on RTX 4090.

On Jetson Orin NX → ~30 FPS (sufficient for CCTV real-time).

🎯 Suggested Model Choice for You

YOLOv12-M (detector, real-time backbone).

Add YOLOv12-Seg or Light DeepLabV3+ if you need pixel-level encroachment mapping.

Build GIS legality logic (Python/Geopandas) to overlay detected structures with restricted zones.

⚠️ Key insight: Your ML model should only detect objects (stalls, tents, buildings, barricades, boats). The “legal vs illegal” classification should be decided by GIS + rules overlay. This keeps the AI explainable and avoids misclassification errors.
